# QuickCal Project Status

## Project Overview
QuickCal is a SaaS platform that consolidates multiple Google Calendars, transcribes meeting audio, provides AI-driven insights, and offers robust task management. The application features a neo-brutalist UI design with a distinctly sarcastic tone throughout the user experience.

## Current Status
The project is in early development with the core framework and authentication flow set up. Basic UI components and page structure have been implemented, but full functionality is not yet available.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React, TailwindCSS
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (Auth.js v5 beta)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Styling:** Custom neo-brutalist design system using TailwindCSS
- **Deployment:** Not yet configured (planned: Vercel)

## Completed Work

### 1. Project Structure
- ✅ Set up Next.js 15 with App Router
- ✅ Organized folder structure for scalability
- ✅ Implemented route grouping for authentication and dashboard sections

### 2. Authentication
- ✅ Configured NextAuth.js with Google OAuth provider
- ✅ Set up Prisma adapter for database integration
- ✅ Created login flow with JWT strategy
- ✅ Implemented protected routes with middleware
- ✅ Added error handling and custom error pages

### 3. Database
- ✅ Defined Prisma schema with the following models:
  - User
  - Account
  - Session
  - VerificationToken
  - CalendarAccount
  - Meeting
  - Task
- ✅ Configured database connection with Supabase PostgreSQL

### 4. UI Components
- ✅ Designed and implemented neo-brutalist component system:
  - Buttons (primary, secondary, small)
  - Boxes and cards
  - Form inputs
  - Navigation elements
  - Typography system
- ✅ Created responsive layouts for all pages

### 5. Pages
- ✅ Landing page with feature showcase
- ✅ Login page with Google authentication
- ✅ Dashboard home with placeholder stats
- ✅ Calendar view (UI only)
- ✅ Account management screens (UI only)
- ✅ Error pages

## Known Issues

1. **Authentication Configuration**: 
   - Type conflicts between NextAuth.js and Prisma adapter
   - Need to ensure proper scope for Google Calendar API access

2. **UI Build Issues**:
   - TailwindCSS configuration errors with custom utilities
   - Need to simplify styling approach for better compatibility

3. **React Version Compatibility**:
   - Some dependencies have conflicts with React 19
   - Need to standardize on React 18 until better compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Authentication Flow**:
   - Complete Google OAuth configuration
   - Test full authentication cycle
   - Ensure token management works correctly

2. **Implement Core Calendar Functionality**:
   - Connect to Google Calendar API
   - Implement basic event fetching
   - Display real calendar data

3. **Stabilize Build Process**:
   - Resolve TailwindCSS configuration issues
   - Standardize environment setup
   - Ensure consistent development experience

4. **Begin AI Integration Research**:
   - Evaluate options for meeting transcription
   - Test preliminary AI analysis capabilities
   - Develop prototype for task extraction

## Google OAuth Configuration

For testing the SSO login, you need to add the following Authorized Redirect URI in your Google Cloud Console:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
```

This is the callback endpoint that Google will redirect to after successful authentication. For production, you would need to add your production domain with the same path.
