# QuickCal – Implementation & Improvement Roadmap

## 1. Current Implementation Overview

QuickCal is a neo‑brutalist, AI‑powered calendar application built with Next.js, NextAuth (v5 beta), and Prisma ORM (PostgreSQL). Our primary features include:

- **User Authentication & Google OAuth Integration**  
  - Users sign in using Google via NextAuth.
  - When a user opts to “Connect Google Calendar” (via `/dashboard/accounts/add`), we trigger a custom OAuth callback that upserts a record in our `CalendarAccount` table and then synchronizes events.

- **Calendar Data Synchronization**  
  - The `GoogleCalendarService` in `lib/google-calendar.ts` fetches events from Google Calendar, supports token refresh, and stores events in the `Meeting` table.
  - Manual syncs can be triggered via a “Sync Calendar” button on our debug page (`/logged-in-calendar`) and during the custom OAuth callback.

- **Dashboard & Account Management**  
  - The Accounts page (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/accounts/page.tsx`) displays connected calendar accounts and their sync statuses.
  - A debug page (`app/logged-in-calendar/page.tsx`) shows detailed CalendarAccount data and a list of meetings.
  
- **Data Models (Prisma Schema)**  
  - **User**: Stores basic user data and is linked to NextAuth’s `Account` and `Session` models.
  - **CalendarAccount**: Holds integration-specific data (OAuth tokens, provider, email, label, settings, sync info).
  - **Meeting**: Contains events synced from Google Calendar.
  - **Task**: (Planned) For task extraction from meetings.

## 2. Files Involved

### Authentication & OAuth Flow
- **`auth.ts`**  
  Contains server‑side actions:
  - `signInWithGoogle()`
  - `connectGoogleCalendar(userId, label)` – initiates Google OAuth with a custom callback URL (or, in our final solution, embeds extra data as needed).

- **`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`**  
  Default NextAuth handler for processing OAuth callbacks.

- **`app/api/auth/callback/google/route.ts`**  
  Our custom callback route that:
  - Wraps the built‑in NextAuth handler.
  - Reads the custom query parameter (e.g. `label`).
  - Uses the authenticated session (and its tokens) to fetch the Google profile.
  - Upserts the CalendarAccount record in our database.
  - Optionally triggers an immediate event sync via `GoogleCalendarService.syncEvents()`.

### Calendar Integration & Utilities
- **`lib/google-calendar.ts`**  
  Contains methods to:
  - Fetch events from Google Calendar.
  - Sync events into the `Meeting` table.
  - Refresh access tokens.
  - Retrieve calendar metadata (timezone, colors, etc.).

- **`lib/account-utils.ts`**  
  Contains helper functions for:
  - Determining if an email is a workspace email.
  - Counting calendar accounts for a user.
  - (Potentially) determining the primary account.

### Dashboard & Debug Pages
- **`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/accounts/page.tsx`**  
  Displays the list of connected calendar accounts (with sync status, label, etc.) and handles status messages from query parameters.

- **`app/dashboard/accounts/add/page.tsx`**  
  The page where users can connect their Google Calendar by providing a label and triggering the OAuth flow.

- **`app/logged-in-calendar/page.tsx`**  
  A debug page that shows:
  - User’s connected CalendarAccount details.
  - A list of Meetings (events) that have been synced.
  - A manual “Sync Calendar” button for testing.

### Database & Schema
- **`prisma/schema.prisma`**  
  Defines our models for User, Account, Session, CalendarAccount, Meeting, and Task.

- **`lib/db.ts`**  
  Initializes and exports the Prisma Client.

## 3. Current Flow Details

1. **User Signs In**  
   - NextAuth handles Google OAuth and creates a User/Account in the database.
   - However, a CalendarAccount record isn’t created until the user explicitly connects their calendar.

2. **Connecting a Calendar Account**  
   - User navigates to `/dashboard/accounts/add` and clicks “Connect Google Calendar.”
   - Our custom connect action in `actions/auth.ts` (using a callback URL like `/api/auth/callback/google?label=…`) initiates the OAuth handshake.
   - The custom callback route in `app/api/auth/callback/google/route.ts`:
     - Completes the OAuth handshake.
     - Retrieves the label from the query parameter.
     - Uses the authenticated session to get the user’s ID and tokens.
     - Calls Google’s API to fetch the user profile.
     - Upserts the CalendarAccount record in our database.
     - Optionally triggers a sync to fetch events from Google Calendar into the `Meeting` table.
   - Finally, the user is redirected (e.g. to `/dashboard/accounts`), and the account appears.

3. **Dashboard and Debug Display**  
   - The Accounts page and debug page show the connected CalendarAccount and a list of Meetings (events) retrieved via the sync process.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

### A. Primary vs. Additional Calendar Accounts
- **Current:**  
  The first CalendarAccount is implicitly treated as “primary.”
- **Improvements:**  
  - Add an explicit flag (e.g. `isPrimary` or `accountType`) to the CalendarAccount model.
  - Update business logic so that:
    - The primary account is automatically connected on initial login (if desired).
    - Users can add additional (secondary) accounts that are marked differently.
  - Provide clear UI/UX distinctions between primary and additional accounts.

### B. Automatic Calendar Data Sync on Initial Login
- **Current:**  
  Sync is triggered only when the user explicitly connects a calendar.
- **Improvements:**  
  - For users who sign in with Google (and have a calendar associated with that account), consider auto‑syncing the primary calendar during initial login.
  - Use background jobs (e.g. with a job queue like Bull or a cron service) to keep calendar data updated without blocking the user’s experience.
  - Ensure error handling and retry mechanisms for token refresh and API rate limits.

### C. Enhanced Project Structure & Separation of Concerns
- **Current:**  
  Implementation is “rough” and tightly coupled in some areas.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Modularize the business logic further. For example:
    - Separate authentication-related code, calendar integration, and sync logic into distinct modules.
    - Create services (e.g. `CalendarService`, `UserService`) to encapsulate complex logic.
  - Separate presentation (UI components) from business logic (API routes, services).

### D. Improved Data Organization & Performance
- **Current:**  
  - Prisma schema defines CalendarAccount, Meeting, etc.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Optimize the Meeting model and queries for handling large datasets (e.g. by adding indexes).
  - Add relationships and foreign keys between CalendarAccount, Meeting, and Task for better data integrity.
  - Consider caching or pagination strategies on the dashboard when displaying large numbers of events.

### E. Robust Error Handling & Logging
- **Current:**  
  Some basic logging is in place (console.error).
- **Improvements:**  
  - Use a structured logging solution for production (e.g. Winston, Pino).
  - Provide more user‑friendly error messages and a fallback flow in the UI.
  - Add centralized error reporting (e.g. Sentry).

### F. Scalability & Industry‑Grade Features
- **Token Management:**  
  - Enhance token refresh logic to run in the background, reducing delays during sync.
- **Background Processing:**  
  - Offload calendar syncs to background jobs to improve response times for users.
- **CI/CD & Testing:**  
  - Establish robust unit/integration tests.
  - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy code with proper environment segregation (development, staging, production).

### G. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Current:**  
  The UI is functional but has a “rough” neo‑brutalist style.
- **Improvements:**  
  - Refine the UI to balance the brutalist aesthetic with modern usability.
  - Improve responsiveness and accessibility.
  - Clearly display primary versus additional calendar accounts.

## 6. Conclusion

Our current implementation provides a functional but rough integration for connecting Google Calendar data into QuickCal. Key next‑steps include:

- **Designating and managing primary versus secondary calendar accounts.**
- **Automating data syncs during initial login and on a schedule.**
- **Refactoring the codebase to modularize services and improve data organization.**
- **Enhancing error handling, logging, UI/UX, and scalability to meet industry standards.**

This document should serve as a roadmap for future improvements and help LLMs and new team members understand our current state and the desired direction for making QuickCal production‑ready.
